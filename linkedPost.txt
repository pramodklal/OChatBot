Hello Guys,



I am back again with a GenAI RAG based application-MultiFIlesChatBOT using Gemini 2.0 & Gemini 1.5 model. RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation and this an AI framework that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources.



This is an interesting application as users can upload three different types of files namely PDF,DOCX and TXT. They can upload max 200 MB per file . At the same time user can upload three format like PDF,DOCX and TXT files.

 



This app based on technology : LangChan,FAISS(Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector database,Streamlit,Gemini,Python 

Again Thanks Google for providing this model FREE for developers. 



MultiFIlesChatBOT app is a Python application that allows the user to chat with multiple PDF documents. User can ask questions in natural language, in the same way as if you were to ask a human, and the application will provide relevant responses based on the content of the uploaded documents.







Uses Cases are



1. Organizations Knowledge Base Access

2. Research and Data Analysis Assistants 

3. Accelerate research in Life Science and Healthcare domain.

4. Legal Document Analysis

5. E-commerce Product Recommendation 



My Expectations?



As of now this app is hosted in Streamlit environment and please Use this app and share your valuable feedback..
